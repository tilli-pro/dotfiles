# Rules

> `001-RULES`

## Purpose

Guidelines for policy creation, ownership, enforcement, and maintenance.

## Description

All policies within the org should maintain some form of rationale for why they exist; all logic related to why policies exist and the circumstances under which they are created reside in this document. This document also describes the circumstances under which a policy could be ignored or amended as a result of either a process flow improvement, extenuating project circumstance, or leadership directive.

| Escape Hatch | Term used to describe methods/ procedures used to break out of a set procedure |

## Ownership

The rules governing policy creation are owned by the organization as a collective entity. Anybody who has issues either with the concept of policy directives, their enforcement, or individual directive rules/ regulations is free to challenge or propose amendments/ changes.

## Who is affected?

Everyone.

## Directives

### Rules are meant to be broken.

The most important consequence of implementing a set of rules and regulations that an org must adhere to is the potential establishment of an inflexible entity that governs organizational procedures and operations. Flexibility (within reason) for policy directives are the important facet of their definition. Every policy directive should enumerate conditions under which it can be safely ignored (delineated via "Escape Hatch(es)").

## Enforcement
